# Clean Code to Modern Software Architecture Design Patterns
---
# Agenda
1. Good Code vs. Bad Code
2. Underengineered Code
   - how to identify, name, and improve underengineered code towards architecture design patterns like hexagonal architecture
3. Overengineered Code
   - demonstrate how dogmatically following architecture design patterns can lead to overengineered code 
4. Conclusions

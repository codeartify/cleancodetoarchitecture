# Good Code vs. Bad Code

---
# What makes code good or bad for you?

---
# Good code minimises costs (time, money, resources)

---
# Accidental vs Essential Complexity

---

# Essential Complexity
- **Definition**: Inherent complexity of the **problem domain**
- Cannot be removed - you must deal with it
- Comes directly from **business rules or requirements**

**Examples**:
- Banking system: interest calculation, regulatory rules
- Compiler: parsing grammar, semantic analysis

---
# Accidental (or Intentionally Added?) Complexity
- **Definition**: Complexity from the **solution/implementation**
- Not required by the problem itself
- Often caused by tools, frameworks, **poor design**, or **bored developers**

**Examples**:
- Monolithic spaghetti codebase with unclear boundaries
- Dogmatically applying the latest architectural design pattern to even the simplest problem

# Key Takeaway
- **Essential complexity**: unavoidable - inherent to the problem domain 
- **Accidental complexity**: avoid it as much as possible
